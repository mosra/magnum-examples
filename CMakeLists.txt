# A single output location. After a decade of saying NO THIS IS A NON-SOLUTION
# TO A NON-PROBLEM I reconsidered my views and enabled this, because:
#
# - On Windows (which don't have RPATH), this makes test execution finally
#   possible without having to install all the stuff first (including the
#   test-only libs, which is ugh).
# - With CMake subprojects, this makes it finally possible to use dynamic
#   plugins directly from the build dir (again without installing anything) ---
#   all plugins are put into the same place, so PluginManager has a single
#   place to look into; and thanks to the dynamic libraries being there as
#   well, this location can be automagically detected as relative to
#   Directory::libraryLocation().
# - Thanks to the $<CONFIG> being part of the output path, you are always sure
#   you never accidentally mix up debug/release libraries when switching
#   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE in an existing build dir.
#
# The runtime location is set to CMAKE_BINARY_DIR and not PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
# because have one runtime location per CMake subproject would not solve much
# either. If the user already provides CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY (even
# empty), it's respected and nothing is being done.
#
# Explicitly using a generator expression to ensure plugins are added to e.g.
# <CONFIG>/lib/magnum/importers/ instead of lib/magnum/importers/<CONFIG>. Also
# adding this to cache, making superprojects pick that up implicitly as well,
# without forcing them to explicitly mirror this setting.
