@brief Integration of [Bullet Physics](http://www.bulletphysics.com) into Magnum.

@m_footernavigation

A rotating table full of cubes that you can shoot down, showcasing the
@ref BulletIntegration library together with @ref SceneGraph using
@ref BulletIntegration::MotionState. It's also possible to visualize various
properties of the Bullet physics world using @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw.

-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **Arrow keys** rotate the camera around
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **mouse click** shoots an object
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **S** toggles between a box (larger, lighter)
    or a sphere (smaller but heavier) to shoot
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **D** toggles draw mode (solid + wireframe debug
