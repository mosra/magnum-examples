@brief Intuitive camera control with smooth navigation.

This is an implementation of [Ken Shoemake's arcball camera](https://www.talisman.org/~erlkonig/misc/shoemake92-arcball.pdf)
with smooth navigation feature. Using arcball, the camera control is more
accurate and consistent. See also the @ref examples-mouseinteraction example
for an alternative approach.

@section examples-arcball-controls Controls

-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **mouse drag** rotates the camera
-   @m_class{m-label m-warning} **Shift** @m_class{m-label m-default} **mouse
    drag** pans the camera
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **mouse wheel** zooms in/out
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **R** resets the camera to its original
    position
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **L** toggles lagging (smooth camera
    navigation)

@section examples-arcball-source Source

Full source code is linked below and also available in the
[magnum-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/master/src/arcball). The `ArcBall.h` and `ArcBall.cpp` files are completely
standalone, depending only on the @ref Math library, and ready to be integrated
into your project. The `ArcBallCamera.h` file provides an optional
@ref SceneGraph integration that you can but don't have to use.
