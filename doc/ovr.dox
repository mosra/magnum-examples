@brief Integration of the [Oculus SDK](http://developer.oculus.com/) into Magnum.

Note that there is also a @ref examples-webxr "WebXR example" and a
@ref examples-leapmotion "Leap Motion example".

@section examples-ovr-usage Usage

This example requires you to have the Oculus Runtime 1.3.0 or newer installed.
Since Oculus only supports Windows, the same holds for the example. If you
don't own a HMD, you can still try the example. If no device is connected, it
will create a debug HMD instead.

@section examples-ovr-controls Key controls

-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **F11** --- toggle performance HUD
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **F12** --- toggle stereo debug HUD
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **M** --- toggle mirroring
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **Escape** --- close the application

@section examples-ovr-credits Credits

This example was originally contributed by [Jonathan Hale](https://github.com/Squareys).
The example makes use of the Oculus SDK, see documentation of the
@ref OvrIntegration namespace for license information.

@section examples-ovr-source Source
