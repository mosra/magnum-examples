@brief Showcase of Magnum distance-field text rendering.

@m_footernavigation

@image html text.png

Instead of rendering the glyphs for each size, the glyphs are prerendered and
converted into a signed distance field texture. The texture is then used for
rendering the text. Both glyph pre-rendering and the actual text layouting
supports UTF-8. For mutable text buffer mapping is used.

@m_div{m-button m-primary} <a href="https://magnum.graphics/showcase/text/">@m_div{m-big}Live web demo @m_enddiv @m_div{m-small} uses WebAssembly & WebGL @m_enddiv </a> @m_enddiv

@section examples-text-usage Usage

@m_class{m-label m-default} **Mouse wheel** rotates and scales the text.

@section examples-text-source Source

Full source code is linked below and together with assets also available in the
[magnum-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/master/src/text).
This example depends on either the @ref Text::FreeTypeFont "FreeTypeFont" or
the @ref Text::StbTrueTypeFont "StbTrueTypeFont" plugin. Neither of them is a
part of the core Magnum repository, see their documentation for usage
instructions.

-   @ref text/TextExample.cpp "TextExample.cpp"

The [ports branch](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/ports/src/text)
contains additional patches for @ref CORRADE_TARGET_EMSCRIPTEN "Emscripten"
support that aren't present in `master` in order to keep the example code as
simple as possible.
