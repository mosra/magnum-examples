Examples demonstrate Magnum features, usage and capabilities. They are not
needed for essential usage, but are useful for learning purposes in addition to
the documentation itself.

@section building-examples-packages Prepared packages

The easiest way to install Magnum Examples is to use one of the ready-made
packages for your platform of choice. See @ref building-examples-manual if you
want to have more control. Cross-compiling is very similar to
@ref building-cross "cross-compiling of Magnum itself".

-   @ref building-examples-packages-arch
-   @ref building-examples-packages-deb
-   @ref building-examples-packages-gentoo
-   @ref building-examples-packages-rpm
-   @ref building-examples-packages-brew

@subsection building-examples-packages-arch ArchLinux packages

In `package/archlinux/magnum-examples-git` there is a package for Git
development build. The package is also in AUR as The package is also in AUR as
[magnum-examples-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/magnum-examples-git/).
It depends on @ref building-corrade-packages-arch "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-arch "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-arch "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-arch "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-integration-packages-arch "Magnum Integration" ArchLinux
packages.

There are also quite a few development packages for native builds or
cross-compilation for Emscripten, Android and MinGW. See the PKGBUILD files in
the `package/archlinux` directory. They allow you to build and install the
package directly from the source tree. Example usage:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples && cd magnum-examples
cd package/archlinux
makepkg -fp PKGBUILD # or any other PKGBUILD file
@endcode

@note The PKGBUILDs reference a few external dependencies such as `imgui-src`
    or (in case of Emscripten) `emscripten-bullet` and `emscripten-box2d`,
    which are not in AUR. You can find PKGBUILDs for these in
    https://github.com/mosra/archlinux. You can also edit the package, disable
    building of affected features and remove the dependency.

Once built, install the package using `pacman`:

@code{.sh}
sudo pacman -U magnum-examples-*.pkg.tar.zst
@endcode

Edit the PKGBUILDs if you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features".

@subsection building-examples-packages-deb Packages for Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives

The `package/debian/` directory contains all files needed for building Debian
packages. You need @ref building-corrade-packages-deb "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-deb "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-deb "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-deb "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-integration-packages-deb "Magnum Integration" Debian packages
installed and in addition also the `dpkg-dev` and `debhelper` packages.
Building is easy, just change directory to package root, link or copy the
`package/debian` directory there and run `dpkg-buildpackage`:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples && cd magnum-examples
ln -s package/debian .
dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign
@endcode

This will compile binary and development packages, which will then appear in a
parent directory. Install them using `dpkg`:

@code{.sh}
sudo dpkg -i ../magnum-examples*.deb
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features", add
them to `dh_auto_configure` at the bottom of `debian/rules`. Watch out, as
indentation has to be done using tabs, not spaces.

@subsection building-examples-packages-gentoo Gentoo Linux ebuilds

Gentoo Git ebuild is available in the `package/gentoo` directory. Get the
@ref building-corrade-packages-gentoo "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-gentoo "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-gentoo "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-gentoo "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-integration-packages-gentoo "Magnum Integration" Gentoo packages
first and then build and install Magnum Examples like this:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples && cd magnum-examples
cd package/gentoo
sudo ebuild dev-libs/magnum-examples/magnum-examples-9999.ebuild manifest clean merge
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features", add
them to `mycmakeargs` in the `*.ebuild` file.

@subsection building-examples-packages-rpm Packages for Fedora, openSUSE and other RPM-based Linux distributions

Spec files for RPM-based distributions are in the `package/rpm/` directory. In
addition you will need to install the following dependencies in order to build
the packages (assuming Fedora Linux):

@code{.sh}
sudo dnf install fedora-packager rpmdevtools
@endcode

After that, make sure you build and install the
@ref building-corrade-packages-rpm "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-rpm "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-rpm "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-rpm "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-integration-packages-rpm "Magnum Integration" RPM packages first,
and run the `build.sh` script. Internally it queries the Git version, makes a
tarball, may ask you to install appropriate dependencies if not present
already, and then builds the package.

@code{.sh}
./package/rpm/build.sh
@endcode

At the end, if everything succeeds, you'll have the newly built packages
located in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS`. The script will print their names at the end.

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features", edit
the `*.spec` file.

@subsection building-examples-packages-brew Homebrew formulas for macOS

macOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas building the latest Git revision are
in the `package/homebrew` directory. Either use the `*.rb` files directly or
use the tap at https://github.com/mosra/homebrew-magnum. This will install the
latest stable version of Magnum Examples with all dependencies:

@code{.sh}
brew install mosra/magnum/magnum-examples
@endcode

But often you may want to install the latest Git revision of all Magnum
projects instead:

@code{.sh}
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/corrade
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-plugins
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-integration
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-extras
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-examples

# If already installed, use the following to upgrade, in the same order
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/corrade
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-plugins
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-integration
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-extras
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-examples
@endcode

When installing from the `*.rb` files you need to install the
@ref building-corrade-packages-brew "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-brew "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-brew "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-extras-packages-brew "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-integration-packages-brew "Magnum Integration" Homebrew packages
first. If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features", edit
the `*.rb` file.

@section building-examples-manual Manual build

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples.
Building the examples is very similar to building Magnum itself. See
@ref building for additonal information about building, cross-compiling and
platform-specific issues. Unlike other Magnum repositories, ports to mobile and
web platforms are provided in the [ports branch](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/ports)
and not present in `master` in order to keep the example code as simple as
possible.

@subsection building-examples-features Enabling or disabling features

Besides building the whole project and enabling a particular subset of
examples, it's also possible to build each example as if the example itself
would be a project root. For example:

@code{.sh}
cd magnum-examples
mkdir build-cubemap && cd build-cubemap
cmake ../src/cubemap
# ...
@endcode
