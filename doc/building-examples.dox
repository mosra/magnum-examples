Examples demonstrate Magnum features, usage and capabilities. They are not
needed for essential usage, but are useful for learning purposes in addition to
the documentation itself.

@section building-examples-packages Prepared packages

The easiest way to install Magnum Examples is to use one of the ready-made
packages for your platform of choice. See @ref building-examples-manual if you
want to have more control. Cross-compiling is very similar to
@ref building-cross "cross-compiling of Magnum itself".

-   @ref building-examples-packages-vcpkg
-   @ref building-examples-packages-arch
-   @ref building-examples-packages-deb
-   @ref building-examples-packages-gentoo
-   @ref building-examples-packages-brew

@subsection building-examples-packages-vcpkg Vcpkg packages on Windows

Unlike with other repositories, Magnum Examples are not available as a
[Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) package because Vcpkg primary use
is for providing libraries to be used by other projects, not for installing
general-purpose apps.

Please follow the @ref building-examples-manual "manual build instructions"
below.

@subsection building-examples-packages-arch ArchLinux packages

In `package/archlinux/magnum-examples-git` there is a package for Git
development build. The package is also in AUR as The package is also in AUR as
[magnum-examples-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/magnum-examples-git/).
It depends on @ref building-corrade-packages-arch "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-arch "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-arch "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-integration-packages-arch "Magnum Integration" and
@ref building-extras-packages-arch "Magnum Extras" ArchLinux packages.

There are also quite a few development packages for native builds or
cross-compilation for Emscripten, Android and MinGW. See the PKGBUILD files in
the `package/archlinux` directory. They allow you to build and install the
package directly from the source tree. Example usage:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples && cd magnum-examples
cd package/archlinux
makepkg -fp PKGBUILD # or any other PKGBUILD file
@endcode

Once built, install the package using `pacman`:

@code{.sh}
sudo pacman -U magnum-examples-*.pkg.tar.xz
@endcode

Edit the PKGBUILDs if you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features".

@subsection building-examples-packages-deb Packages for Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives

Prebuilt packages of the latest stable version for Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 and
18.04 are available through a PPA. To install packages related to Magnum and
Corrade, you can add the repository and then install the packages with the
following commands:

@code{.sh}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chrome/magnum.graphics
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install magnum-examples
@endcode

For more information about these packages, please visit
[the PPA page](https://launchpad.net/~chrome/+archive/ubuntu/magnum.graphics).

To build your own package, the `package/debian/` directory contains all files
needed for building Debian packages. You need
@ref building-corrade-packages-deb "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-deb "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-deb "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-integration-packages-deb "Magnum Integration" and
@ref building-extras-packages-deb "Magnum Extras" Debian packages installed and
in addition also the `dpkg-dev` and `debhelper` packages. Building is easy,
just change directory to package root, link or copy the `package/debian`
directory there and run `dpkg-buildpackage`:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples && cd magnum-examples
ln -s package/debian .
dpkg-buildpackage
@endcode

This will compile binary and development packages, which will then appear in a
parent directory. Install them using `dpkg`:

@code{.sh}
sudo dpkg -i ../magnum-examples*.deb
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features", add
them to `dh_auto_configure` at the bottom of `debian/rules`. Watch out, as
indentation has to be done using tabs, not spaces.

@subsection building-examples-packages-gentoo Gentoo Linux ebuilds

Gentoo Git ebuild is available in the `package/gentoo` directory. Get the
@ref building-corrade-packages-gentoo "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-gentoo "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-gentoo "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-integration-packages-gentoo "Magnum Integration" and
@ref building-extras-packages-gentoo "Magnum Extras" Gentoo packages first and
then build and install Magnum Examples like this:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples && cd magnum-examples
cd package/gentoo
sudo ebuild dev-libs/magnum-examples/magnum-examples-99999.ebuild manifest clean merge
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features", add
them to `mycmakeargs` in the `*.ebuild` file.

@subsection building-examples-packages-brew Homebrew formulas for macOS

macOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas building the latest Git revision are
in the `package/homebrew` directory. Either use the `*.rb` files directly or
use the tap at https://github.com/mosra/homebrew-magnum. This will install the
latest stable version of Magnum Examples with all dependencies:

@code{.sh}
brew install mosra/magnum/magnum-examples
@endcode

But often you may want to install the latest Git revision of all Magnum
projects instead:

@code{.sh}
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/corrade
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-plugins
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-integration
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-extras
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-examples
@endcode

When installing from the `*.rb` files you need to install the
@ref building-corrade-packages-brew "Corrade",
@ref building-packages-brew "Magnum",
@ref building-plugins-packages-brew "Magnum Plugins",
@ref building-integration-packages-brew "Magnum Integration" and
@ref building-extras-packages-brew "Magnum Extras" Homebrew packages first. If
you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-examples-features "enable / disable additional features", edit
the `*.rb` file.

@section building-examples-manual Manual build

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples.
Building the examples is very similar to building Magnum itself. See
@ref building for additonal information about building, cross-compiling and
platform-specific issues. Unlike other Magnum repositories, ports to mobile and
web platforms are provided in the [ports branch](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/ports)
and not present in `master` in order to keep the example code as simple as
possible.

@subsection building-examples-features Enabling or disabling features

Besides building the whole project and enabling a particular subset of
examples, it's also possible to build each example as if the example itself
would be a project root. For example:

@code{.sh}
cd magnum-examples
mkdir build-cubemap && cd build-cubemap
cmake ../src/cubemap
# ...
@endcode
