/** @page examples-triangle-vulkan Triangle using Vulkan
@brief Directly using Vulkan with hand-written SPIR-V to produce a triangle offscreen.

@image html triangle-vulkan.png

This example has equivalent output to the OpenGL @ref examples-triangle "Triangle"
example, but uses Vulkan instead. Showcases how to use Magnum builtin
[flextGL](https://github.com/mosra/flextgl)-generated headers to load Vulkan
function pointers, create the Vulkan instance, create the device, do the
initial setup, handcraft a SPIR-V shader bytecode and render a basic rainbow
triangle offscreen, exporting it to a PNG file using the
@ref Trade::AbstractImageConverter APIs.
