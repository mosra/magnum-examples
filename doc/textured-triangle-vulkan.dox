/** @page examples-textured-triangle-vulkan Textured triangle using Vulkan
@brief Showcases Vulkan descriptor sets and SPIR-V assembly.

@m_footernavigation

@image html textured-triangle.png

This example has output similar to the OpenGL
@ref examples-texturedquad "Textured Quad" example, but uses Vulkan instead,
building on top of @ref examples-triangle-vulkan. In addition there's a texture
and descriptor layout / set / pool setup and sampling in the SPIR-V shader
assembly.

@section examples-textured-triangle-vulkan-source Source

Full source code is linked below and together with assets also available in the
[magnum-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/master/src/textured-triangle-vulkan).
This example depends on the @ref Trade, @ref ShaderTools and @ref Vk libraries
and in addition needs the @ref Trade::StbImageImporter "StbImageImporter",
@ref Trade::AnyImageConverter "AnyImageConverter"
plugins and some `PngImageConverter` implementation -- see @ref file-formats.
Not all are enabled by default in most cases, see their documentation for usage
instructions.
