Note that there is also a @ref examples-ovr "Oculus SDK example". Combined with
this, you can have your hands in virtual reality!

@section examples-leapmotion-usage Usage

This example requires you to have the [Orion beta](https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started) or
[Leap Motion V2 Desktop SDK](https://developer.leapmotion.com/sdk/v2) installed.
In addition, you will need a [Leap Motion Controller](https://store.leapmotion.com/).

@section examples-leapmotion-controls Controls

-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **Move hands** --- well, move hands
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **Escape** --- close the application

@section examples-leapmotion-credits Credits

This example was originally contributed by [Jonathan Hale](https://github.com/Squareys).
This example makes use of the Leap Motion SDK, see https://leapmotion.com/ for
license information.

@section examples-leapmotion-source Source

Full source code is linked below and also available in the
[magnum-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/master/src/leapmotion).
This example depends on the [LeapMotion SDK](https://leapmotion.com/) which you
need to install separately; additionally you need to put [FindLeap.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/blob/master/modules/FindLeap.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory.
