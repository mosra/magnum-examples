@brief Loose octree for accelerating collision detection.

Simple, single-threaded implementation of a [loose octree](https://anteru.net/blog/2008/loose-octrees/)
which is commonplace in computer graphics. In this example, octree is used for
collision detection.

@m_div{m-button m-primary} <a href="https://magnum.graphics/showcase/octree/">@m_div{m-big} Live web demo @m_enddiv @m_div{m-small} uses WebAssembly & WebGL @m_enddiv </a> @m_enddiv

@section examples-octree-controls Controls

-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **mouse drag** rotates the camera
-   @m_class{m-label m-warning} **Shift** @m_class{m-label m-default} **mouse
    drag** pans the camera
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **mouse wheel** zooms in/out
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **R** resets the camera to its original
    transformation
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **O** switches between a brute force and octree
    collision detection
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **B** shows/hides tree node bounding boxes
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **P** toggles frame profiling to the console
    using @ref DebugTools::FrameProfiler
-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **Space** pauses/resumes particle simulation

Additionally, various options can be set via command line:

-   `-s`, `--spheres N` --- number of spheres to simulate (default: 2000)
-   `-r`, `--sphere-radius R` --- sphere radius (default: 0.0333)
-   `-v`, `--sphere-velocity V` ---  sphere velocity (default: 0.05)

With the default setting, the octree collision detection is about twice as fast
than the brute force method. In order to better see the octree visualization,
run the example for example with the following parameters:

@code{.sh}
./magnum-octree -s 20 -r 0.1 -v 1.0
@endcode

@section examples-octree-source Source

Full source code is linked below and also available in the
[magnum-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/master/src/octree).
This example depends on the @ref examples-arcball example for camera
navigation.

-   @ref octree/LooseOctree.cpp "LooseOctree.cpp"
-   @ref octree/LooseOctree.h "LooseOctree.h"
-   @ref octree/OctreeExample.cpp "OctreeExample.cpp"
-   @ref octree/CMakeLists.txt "CMakeLists.txt"

The [ports branch](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/ports/src/octree)
contains additional patches for @ref CORRADE_TARGET_EMSCRIPTEN "Emscripten"
support that aren't present in `master` in order to keep the example code as
simple as possible.
