@brief Basic WebVR application.

@image html webvr.png

This example is a basic demonstration of how to use the
[Emscripten VR API](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/api_reference/vr.h.html)
with Magnum.

For the full experience, this example requires a WebVR 1.1 capable browser and
a VR headset. You may need to enable WebVR support explicitly on your browser.
