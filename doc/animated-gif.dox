@brief Playing back an animated GIF. On the GPU or in a terminal.

@image html animated-gif.png width=400px

Makes use of @ref Trade::StbImageImporter "StbImageImporter"'s animated GIF
support, the @ref Animation library, and texture transform in
@ref Shaders::FlatGL to load and play back a short GIF animation. Additionally,
there's a console version of the same, rendering the animation into a
compatible terminal using @ref Utility-Debug-modifiers-colors "Debug's color output"
capabilities.

@section examples-animated-gif-usage Usage

Pass a path to an animated GIF file to either of the executables. A sample GIF
is bundled in the repository, see the links below.

-   @m_class{m-label m-default} **Space** pauses / unpauses the animation in
    the graphical version
-   @m_class{m-label m-warning} **Ctrl** @m_class{m-label m-default} **C**
    aborts playback in the console version
