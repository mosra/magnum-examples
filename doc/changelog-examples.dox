@section changelog-examples-latest Changes since 2020.06

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Minimal supported CMake version is now 3.5, changed from 3.4, since CMake
    3.27+ warns if a compatibility with CMake below 3.5 is requested. Older
    versions are not supported anymore and all workarounds for them were
    removed. This is a conservative change, as there are no known supported
    distributions which would have anything older than 3.5.

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-new New features

-   The @ref examples-triangle-vulkan is now written fully using the new
    @ref Vk and @ref ShaderTools libraries, with no raw Vulkan code left
-   New @ref examples-textured-triangle-vulkan, mirroring the OpenGL
    @ref examples-texturedquad with Vulkan APIs

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-changes Changes and improvements

-   The original Textured Triangle example was changed to
    @ref examples-texturedquad to show also a low-level indexed mesh setup
-   The @ref examples-primitives example got significantly simplified by using
    @ref MeshTools::compile() instead of inflexible, verbose and slow
    lower-level APIs. Description of those got moved to the
    @ref Trade::MeshData class documentation.
-   Fixed the @ref examples-webxr example to look correctly on HiDPI
-   The WebVR example was obsoleted by the @ref examples-webxr example and is
    now removed
-   The @ref examples-cubemap example can now load combined cube map files
    such as EXR

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-buildsystem Build system

-   Updated the @ref examples-box2d example to work with latest Box2D 2.4 (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#90](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/90)
    and [mosra/magnum-examples#92](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/92))
-   Linux, Emscripten and macOS builds were migrated from Travis to Circle CI
-   The Homebrew package now uses `std_cmake_args` instead of hardcoded build
    type and install prefix, which resolves certain build issues (see
    [mosra/homebrew-magnum#6](https://github.com/mosra/homebrew-magnum/pull/6))
-   Updated Debian build instructions to pass `--no-sign` to
    `dpkg-buildpackage`, avoiding a confusing error message that might lead
    people to think the packaging failed (see [mosra/magnum-plugins#105](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/issues/105))
-   It's now possible to use `<PackageName>_ROOT` to point to install locations
    of dependencies such as Corrade on CMake 3.12+, in addition to putting them
    all together inside `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`. See also [mosra/magnum#614](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/614).
-   Examples are now put into a MagnumExamples folder on MSVC and Xcode (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#107](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/107))

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   The `ports` branch of the @ref examples-picking was fixed to work properly
    on Firefox ... after three long years. See
    [mosra/magnum-examples#53](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/53).
-   The @ref examples-octree example got fixed to properly remove all invalid
    points (see [mosra/magnum-examples#99](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/99))
-   The @ref examples-viewer used a wrong logic for generating mesh normals
    (see [mosra/magnum-examples#109](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/109))

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-deprecated Deprecated APIs

-   All @ref building-examples-features "CMake build options" are now prefixed
    with `MAGNUM_`. For backwards compatibility, unless
    @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED is disabled and unless a prefixed option is
    already set during the initial run, the unprefixed options are still
    recognized with a warning. See also [mosra/corrade#139](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/issues/139).
-   The `WITH_TEXTUREDTRIANGLE_EXAMPLE` CMake option is still recognized on
    builds with @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED enabled, but will produce a
    warning. Use `MAGNUM_WITH_TEXTUREDQUAD_EXAMPLE` instead.

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-documentation Documentation

-   Updated license link for Source Sans Pro used by the
    @ref examples-fluidsimulation2d, @ref examples-fluidsimulation3d,
    @ref examples-imgui and @ref examples-text examples (see [mosra/magnum-examples#95](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/95))

-   The @ref examples-imgui "ImGui example" now lets ImGui update the
    application cursor (see [mosra/magnum-integration#56](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/56))
-   Avoid using obsolete APIs in the @ref examples-imgui "ImGui example" (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#65](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/65))
-   Fixed the @ref examples-picking to not limit object count to 256 (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#79](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/79))
-   Ported the @ref examples-picking to use the new builtin Object ID support
    in @cpp Shaders::Phong @ce instead of a custom shader (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#81](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/81))
-   The @ref examples-box2d and @ref examples-bullet examples are now using
    instanced rendering to draw the whole scene in a single draw call.

@subsection changelog-examples-2020-06-buildsystem Build system

-   The library again compiles and tests cleanly with @ref CORRADE_NO_ASSERT
    enabled, and this setup is verified on the CI to avoid further regressions

@subsection changelog-examples-2020-06-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   The @ref examples-picking and @ref examples-bullet examples weren't
    properly handling mouse events on HiDPI systems that have different window
    and framebuffer size (see [mosra/magnum-examples#72](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/72)
    and [mosra/magnum-examples#74](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/74))

@subsection changelog-examples-2019-10-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Minimal supported CMake version is now 3.4. Older versions are not
    supported anymore and all workarounds for them were removed. Download a
    prebuilt release of a newer version if you need to use Corrade on older
    systems (such as Ubuntu 14.04 or Debian 8). This is a conservative change
    that shouldn't affect any additional distribution compared to the CMake 3.1
    requirement in 2019.01.

@subsection changelog-examples-2019-10-new New features

-   New @ref examples-dart example showing integration with DART using

    @ref Platform::EmscriptenApplication on Emscripten (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#60](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/60)
    and [mosra/magnum-examples#59](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/59))
-   Switched the @ref examples-motionblur and @ref examples-picking examples
    to use @ref MeshTools::compile() for a clearer and easier-to-understand
    code (see also [mosra/magnum-examples#62](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/62))
-   The @ref examples-cubemap now tries to find the bundles images first
    instead of requiring the user to always pass a path (see also
    [mosra/magnum-examples#44](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/44))
-   Documented how to enable and use importer plugins in
    @ref examples-texturedquad and @ref examples-viewer (see
    [mosra/magnum#375](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/375))

@subsection changelog-examples-2019-10-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   The @ref examples-arealights example wasn't using the depth buffer
    (see [mosra/magnum-examples#57](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/57))
-   Adaptations to header cleanup in Magnum for faster compile times, various
    other cleanup (see [mosra/magnum-examples#54](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/54),
    [mosra/magnum-examples#66](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/66))
