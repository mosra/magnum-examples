-   New @ref examples-box2d example showing usage with Box2D
-   New @ref examples-mouseinteraction example showing advanced mouse
    interaction (see [mosra/magnum-examples#46](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/46))
-   New @ref examples-triangle-vulkan example showcasing basic Vulkan usage
    with Magnum

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-buildsystem Build system

-   There's now a PPA for Ubuntu packages. See @ref building-examples-packages-deb

@section changelog-examples-2018-04 2018.04

Released 2018-05-01, tagged as
[v2018.04](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/releases/tag/v2018.04).

@subsection changelog-examples-2018-04-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Building for Android now requires CMake 3.7 with builtin Android
    crosscompilation support, the old toolchains were removed. Only the Clang
    and libc++ toolchain is now supported, support for GCC and libstdc++ was
    dropped, as it was still missing some important C++11 functionality. See
    @ref building-cross-android for more information.

@subsection changelog-examples-2018-04-new New features

-   New @ref examples-leapmotion example showcasing hand tracking
    (see [mosra/magnum-examples#40](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/40))
-   New @ref examples-triangle-sokol example showcasing use of Magnum with
    custom renderers

@subsection changelog-examples-2018-04-changes Changes and improvements

-   Simplified the @ref examples-ovr example to a single file with minimal
    dependencies (see [mosra/magnum-examples#39](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/39))

@subsection changelog-examples-2018-04-buildsystem Build system

-   It's now possible to build particular examples as if they would be a
    project root. See @ref building-examples-features and
    [mosra/magnum#241](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/241) for more information.
-   Homebrew macOS packages were updated to install the stable version by
    default
-   Fixed the Debian package to not include a revision. While just a warning on
    Ubuntu, it's a hard error on Debian. (See [mosra/corrade#44](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/issues/44).)

@subsection changelog-examples-2018-04-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   The @ref examples-webvr example was fixed to work on Android phones

-   Continuous testing for Linux, macOS, Windows MSVC, Windows MinGW, Windows RT,
    iOS, Android and Emscripten on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mosra/magnum-examples)

    coverage on [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/mosra/magnum-examples);
    replacing the unmaintained and outdated Jenkins configuration
-   Support for CMake subprojects. You can now clone Magnum Plugins into a

    The @cmake find_package() @ce command will then use the CMake subproject
    instead of looking for it in system-wide locations.
-   CMake targets are now organized in folders for better development
    experience in IDEs such as Visual Studio or Xcode
-   Added a @ref building-examples-packages-brew "Homebrew package"
-   `MACOSX_RPATH` is now enabled by default on CMake 3.0+

    up initial CMake run

    16bit depth buffer ([possibly related Firefox bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1202387),
    see [mosra/magnum-examples#34](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/34))
-   Fixed Greek text in the @ref examples-text example (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#35](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/35))

@subsection changelog-examples-2018-02-documentation Documentation

-   New documentation theme powered by [m.css](http://mcss.mosra.cz) and
    related massive updates of *everything*
-   All examples, even the ones without a tutorial, have now their dedicated
    documentation page with a screenshot, source listing and possibly a link
    to the live web version
-   The @ref building-examples documentation now prefers package installation
    instead of manual build

Changelogs for previous versions are available in
@ref changelog-examples-old "Archived example changelogs".
