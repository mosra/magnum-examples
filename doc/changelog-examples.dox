@section changelog-examples-latest Changes since 2019.10

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-new New features

-   New @ref examples-fluidsimulation3d example (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#69](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/69),
    [mosra/magnum-examples#70](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/70))
-   New @ref examples-webxr example (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#73](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/73))

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-changes Changes and improvements

-   The @ref examples-imgui "ImGui example" now lets ImGui update the
    application cursor (see [mosra/magnum-integration#56](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/56))

@section changelog-examples-2019-10 2019.10

Released 2019-10-24, tagged as
[v2019.10](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/releases/tag/v2019.10).

@subsection changelog-examples-2019-10-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Minimal supported CMake version is now 3.4. Older versions are not
    supported anymore and all workarounds for them were removed. Download a
    prebuilt release of a newer version if you need to use Corrade on older
    systems (such as Ubuntu 14.04 or Debian 8). This is a conservative change
    that shouldn't affect any additional distribution compared to the CMake 3.1
    requirement in 2019.01.

@subsection changelog-examples-2019-10-new New features

-   New @ref examples-dart example showing integration with DART using
    @ref DartIntegration (see [mosra/magnum-examples#63](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/63))

@subsection changelog-examples-2019-10-changes Changes and improvements

-   Switched all examples to use the new
    @ref Platform::EmscriptenApplication on Emscripten (see
    [mosra/magnum-examples#60](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/60)
    and [mosra/magnum-examples#59](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/59))
-   Switched the @ref examples-motionblur and @ref examples-picking examples
    to use @ref MeshTools::compile() for a clearer and easier-to-understand
    code (see also [mosra/magnum-examples#62](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/62))
-   The @ref examples-cubemap now tries to find the bundles images first
    instead of requiring the user to always pass a path (see also
    [mosra/magnum-examples#44](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/44))
-   Documented how to enable and use importer plugins in
    @ref examples-textured-triangle and @ref examples-viewer (see
    [mosra/magnum#375](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/375))

@subsection changelog-examples-2019-10-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   The @ref examples-arealights example wasn't using the depth buffer
    (see [mosra/magnum-examples#57](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/57))
-   Adaptations to header cleanup in Magnum for faster compile times, various
    other cleanup (see [mosra/magnum-examples#54](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/54),
    [mosra/magnum-examples#66](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/issues/66))

    crosscompilation support, the old toolchains were removed. Only the Clang
    and libc++ toolchain is now supported, support for GCC and libstdc++ was
    dropped, as it was still missing some important C++11 functionality. See
    @ref building-cross-android for more information.

@subsection changelog-examples-2018-04-new New features

    (see [mosra/magnum-examples#40](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/pull/40))

-   New documentation theme powered by [m.css](http://mcss.mosra.cz) and
    related massive updates of *everything*
-   All examples, even the ones without a tutorial, have now their dedicated
    documentation page with a screenshot, source listing and possibly a link
    to the live web version
-   The @ref building-examples documentation now prefers package installation
    instead of manual build

Changelogs for previous versions are available in
@ref changelog-examples-old "Archived example changelogs".
