# Find EGL
# --------
#
# Finds the EGL library. This module defines:
#
#  EGL_FOUND            - True if EGL library is found
#  EGL::EGL             - EGL imported target
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#
#  EGL_LIBRARY          - EGL library
#  EGL_INCLUDE_DIR      - Include dir
