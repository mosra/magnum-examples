# Find Vulkan
# -----------
#
# Finds the Vulkan library. This module defines:
#
#  Vulkan_FOUND         - True if Vulkan library is found
#  Vulkan::Vulkan       - Vulkan imported target
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#
#  Vulkan_LIBRARY       - Vulkan library
#
# Please note this find module is tailored especially for the needs of Magnum.
# In particular, it doesn't look for Vulkan includes as Magnum has its own,
# generated using flextGL.
#

#
#   This file is part of Magnum.

# libvulkan.so *should* link against pthread on its own, but in some rare
# corner cases (like the 1.2.203 ArchLinux package) it doesn't -- most probably
# due to the vulkan loader wrongly using `-lpthread` instead of `-pthread` and
# then the linker DCEing out the reference to it based on some unfortunate
# combination of compiler/linker flags?
#
# In that case using drivers that rely on pthread (such as SwiftShader) would
# lead to a nasty std::system_error telling me to link to pthreads. As I can't
# have control over how the loader links to pthread or whether at all, and what
# random packaging issues happened in various distributions, I have to link to
# it explicitly to be immune against such issues.
