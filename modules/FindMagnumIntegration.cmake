# - Find Magnum integration library
#
# Basic usage:
#  find_package(MagnumIntegration [REQUIRED])
# This command tries to find Magnum integration library and then defines:
#  MAGNUMINTEGRATION_FOUND      - Whether the library was found
# This command alone is useless without specifying the components:
#  Bullet                       - Bullet Physics integration library
# Example usage with specifying additional components is:
#  find_package(MagnumIntegration [REQUIRED|COMPONENTS]
#               Bullet)
# For each component is then defined:
#  MAGNUM_*INTEGRATION_FOUND    - Whether the component was found
#  MAGNUM_*INTEGRATION_LIBRARIES - Component library and dependent libraries
