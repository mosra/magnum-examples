# Find OpenAL
# -----------
#
# Finds the OpenAL library. This module defines:
#
#  OpenAL_FOUND         - True if the OpenAL library is found
#  OpenAL::OpenAL       - OpenAL imported target
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#
#  OPENAL_LIBRARY       - OpenAL library
#  OPENAL_DLL_RELEASE   - OpenAL release DLL on Windows, if found. Note that
#   in case of the binary OpenAL Soft distribution it's named soft_oal.dll and
#   you need to rename it to OpenAL32.dll to make it work.
#  OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR   - Include dir
#
