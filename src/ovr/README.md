into Magnum.

Notes
-----

This example requires you to have the Oculus Runtime 1.3.0 or newer installed.
Since Oculus only supports Windows, the same holds for the example.

If you don't own a HMD, you can still try the example. If no device is
connected, it will create a debug HMD instead.

Key controls
------------

*   **F11**: toggle performance HUD.
*   **F12**: toggle stereo debug HUD.
*   **M**: Toggle mirroring.
*   **Escape key**: Close the application.
